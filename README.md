# Manual tester Portfolio #

# About me #

My name is Karolina and I'm looking for my first job as a tester.

Previously, I worked for the bailiff and Social Insurance Institution (ZUS). I think that my previous experience prepared me to work as a software tester because I developed the soft skills necessary for me to work in this position. Working for the bailiff required high personal culture and self-discipline from me. I focused on timeliness and quality of tasks. I am a communicative person with an optimistic attitude to new tasks. I can work in a team. I have experience in contact with difficult people.

I want to work in IT because I want to work remotely and from time to time work other hours than 8-16. My previous jobs didn't give me that.
